# greek_laws_consolidation_code
This folder contains all the code for implementing a semi-automatic system for the consolidation of Greek legislative texts. It is divided up to a 7-step modules execution based on the architecture described at [Openlaws](http://www.openlaws.gr/legislation/2016/10/17/revised-architecture/). This code has been tested over 550 laws from which 320 may be described as valid according to Central Legislatorial Committee rules. Python 2.7 edition has been used for all steps. 

## Dependencies
Many modules depend on Python's lxml API (see [lxml](http://lxml.de/tutorial.html)) and Natural Language Toolkit (see [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html) mostly on steps 5 and 6 as described below. Moreover, a Greek POS tagger from AUEB Natural Language Processing Group has been used for identifyong all verbs that participate in a modification and are the basis for constructing 19 regular expressions that

## STEP 1
see tutorial of ultraclarity-crawler [here](https://github.com/OpenLawsGR/ultraclarity-crawler) for downloading PDF files of the Official Government Gazzette.

## STEP 2
As Law documents are published in PDF format there is the need to transform them in a format that can easily be processed. An open sourve utility named 'pdftotext' is being used to transform PDF files to plain text documents. This utility has several problems when it is used in PDF files, usually published before 2004 due to scanned images.
Inside pdftotext.py change variables "src", "text_dest" and "rules_file" accordingly and run the command below from terminal
> python pdfotext.py

## STEP 3
Distinction of Laws from different types of legislative texts is necessary as the work focuses solely on Laws. Use extract_laws.py as below but first it is necessary to define the source and destinations folders in the beginning of the python file. To run this module in terminal type:
> python extract_laws.py

## STEP 4
In this step split_laws_international_agreements.py can be used to correct several errors, either already present in the PDF files or produced during the previous steps. Moreover international agreements may be removed due to their lack of importance for citizens. To run this module in terminal type:
> python split_laws_international_agreements.py

## STEP 5
In this step structural analysis is been implemented. In order to automatically perform transformations to a lawâ€™s content according to a modification, it is necessary to be aware of the structure of each law. Modifications refer to structural elements (such as articles, paragraphs, sub-paragraphs etc.) 
To run this module in terminal type:
> python create_xml_with_mod.py

Before moving to steps 6 and 7 an extra step of Validation and Manual Editing is necessary. Law texts may contain grammar or syntax errors and misprints. Moreover, rules and patterns are not always followed by law makers. Due to the nature of these errors and because manual editing is a challenging and mentally demanding task all text files that contain valid laws can be found at *valid_xml* folder.

## STEP 6 and 7
Use *implement_mod.py* to automatically apply all modifications found in law's XML files. For detecting the patterns that match a modification a random sample of 100 laws has been used, and by using a Greek POS tagger from AUEB Natural Language Processing Group, modificatory verbs have been identified and used to construct 19 regular expressions that capture successfully 96% of modifications existing in the sample. In this last step the appropriate XSL transformations are applied to the XML files that represent laws revisions in order to generate user friendly text versions of them. Before this module can be used it is necessary to initialize 2 git repository and declare them in the beginning of the script. 
To run this module in terminal type:
> python implement_mod.py
